# portfolio-watch
Playing with serverless, simple application to weekly check low priced stocks and send an alarm email. Additionally another lambda goes through a list in DynamoDB (currently held portfolio) and checks if the position is ready to close. Both cheap stock and close position checker are of course very simple, feel free to do something more sophisticated there :)
